## Santierele Iasului

### Description

Santierele Iasului is a project for master's Multimedia class which I presented in March. The idea for this project came after our teacher told us to create a multimedia project about the problems of Iasi. At that time in the city there were many build sites which represented a big problem for citizens.

For this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I want to mention that the JS part was not written by me, because at that time I didn't start to learn JS. So, just HTML and CSS files are mine.
